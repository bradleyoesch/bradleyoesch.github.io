# Laser League

Hey! I've been working on a movie idea about a professional laser tagger, going for something like Dodgeball absurdity + Talladega Nights sincerity + Hot Rod silliness + Wet Hot American Summer surrealism.

I've written up an eight page summary of the full story, which may take around fifteen minutes to read. If you have some time, feel free to read some or all of it and let me know what you think! You can also answer however many questions in the feedback form as you'd like. Optional, anonymous, etc etc.

Thanks for reading!
