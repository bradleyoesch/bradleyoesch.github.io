# Laser League

Hey! I've been working on a movie idea about a professional laser tagger, going for something like Dodgeball absurdity + Talladega Nights sincerity + Hot Rod silliness + Wet Hot American Summer surrealism.

I've written up an eight page summary of the full story, which may take around fifteen minutes to read. It's the first draft, a rough draft, so it has plenty I don't love, details omitted, things that will get dropped etc. So I'd love some feedback.

For anyone who's interested, feel free to read some or all of it and let me know what you think! There's also a lil feedback form, you can answer some questions in there if you want. Optional, anonymous, etc etc.

Thank you!!
